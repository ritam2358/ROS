# ROS Task 1

I was very busy the previous 2 weeks so I was not able to do any of the tasks.I had a lot of backlogs, I was also working on the AUV Website, SNT Summer Project. I also was sick for aroung 2 days due to vaccine and thus it increased the backloga I had which I had to cover. 
I was only able to go through the turorials regarding what are packages, topics, messages and how they interact with each other, the usgae of node and stuff. 
I spent around 6 hrs going through the ROS tutorials. I basically did not get the time to attempt the questions properly. I will be able to do so after this weekend.
