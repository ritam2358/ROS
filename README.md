# ROS Task 1

I was very busy the previous 2 weeks so I was not able to do any of the tasks.I had a lot of backlogs, I was also working on the AUV Website, SNT Summer Project. 
I was only able to go through the turorials regarding what are packages, topics, messages and how they interact with each other. 
I spent around 6 hrs going through the ROS tutorials. I basically did not get the time to attempt the questions properly. I will be able to do so after this weekend.
